Combopool protocal
============

ComboPool lets you pool governance tokens (GTs), such as COMP, BAL, LEND, YFI, BZRX, AKRO, and many others.
In the absence of Combo pool, the minority token holders cant extract minimal utility from such tokens for two reasons:
| Their votes to not carry weight, hence no influence.
| The significant share of such tokens don't provide any income.
As a result, the fundamental value of such tokens for the minority holder is close to zero, and protocols face voter’s apathy problem.
